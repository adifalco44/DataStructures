    I represented my binary trees using a vector. Upon recieving input, the
program enters a while loop that ends after the specified length of the
tree is met. Through each iteration, the value present is pushed back
into the tree vector. After the last element is added, the checkTree
function is called. It starts with the declaration of a boolean flag as true.
Then, it iterates through all elements in the vector. If the child nodes are
within the bounds of the vector, they are checked. If the left child
is greater than the parent, the flag is set to false. If the right tree is
less than or equal to the parent node, the flag is set to false. The flag is
returned in the main function, and used to print the results.
