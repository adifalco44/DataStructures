    From the users perspective, this program takes in a 
graph's parent nodeswith resepct to their children, and then 
helps the user determine if there is a path from said node to another.

    From the programmers perspective, this program utilizes an
overarching while loop, multiple small helper functions, and STL
vectors in order to determine if there is a path from a parent node
 to a specified child. 

    In order to test for errors, I simply input from the input file 
and compared to the given outut file. Overall, the program works, but 
the make-test command stalls for quite some time. I believe that my
update function overloads when more than two graphs are represented,
which is an obvious issue.

    I used a deviation of the breadth first search algorithm.
