   From the users perspective, the blackjack program is fairly simple to use.
If the player wishes tto hit, he is to prss 0. If he wishes to stay, he 
is to  press 1. Eventually, the game stops when a winner is found.
Then, the user is asked whether they want to keep playing or not.
   From the programmers perspective, the blackjack game is designed using 
a class with several helper functions that assist larger functions
in their efforts. For instance, I designed a getHand and SetHand to 
help when a new dek is shuffled, since the hands dealt are private data
in my class.
   To verify this program, I ran it several times and looked for errors.
I realized after the weekend that 0 cards and 11 cards arent actual values, 
so i went into the program and modified it slightly. After the modifications,
my program encounters several problems at random. I don't know how to fix
them at this point, and the deadline is encroaching, so I can't "verify"
what I know is clearly wrong.
