    I referenced the capabilities of our webpage in my report, but I
will reiterate them. My executable, test_output.py, creates a unique 
static webpage that is generated using strings from standard input. This
means that when the rest of our programs are functioning, this program 
will be able to crete a webpage directly from their ouput. I have learned 
how to format styles in HTML, hyperlink other websites, and create
temporary webpages using Python. I think the executable is enough to 
secure me the final twenty points, because it is nearly finished -- in the
sense that I wont have to change much before reimplemeneting it for final
submission.
