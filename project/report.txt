    The code that I wrote generates a static HTML page with
standrd HTML capabilities. The program asks the user for preffered
foods, and then the program uing string formatting to create a personlized
webpage for every use. This program will take in data from standard 
input when the rest of the application is finished, but for now
this model shows the versatility of the code tht I wrote. 

    I spent about two hours researching vrious methods of creating 
HTML pages from python and C++, and decided not to use templating 
methods. Rather, I dedicated two more hours to learning a basic method
of creating HTML directly from python using the webbrowser library. Then,
I spent about three hours learning the basics of HTML. I figured out how
to declare styles and hyperlink other webpages, which I feel shows that
our template output file is already close to completion.
