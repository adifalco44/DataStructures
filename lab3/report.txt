   From the users perspective, this program is a simple additive calculator.
The used can feed a file into the program, and then it will add integers 
listed two at a time. This utility is special because it remains precise
past the boundaries given by double long addition and float addition.
   From the programmers perspective, this program is a relatively *simple
linked list. It utilizes nodes connected through memory to create
a data structure that contains integer values. These nodes are accessed 
through several functions to perform simple addition along each
place-value of a given integer. My main program reads in two strings at a 
time using string stream. These strings are then spliced by digit, and
then are transformed into integer values -- these values are stored in the T
data of a created node. After these lists are created, a listname.addNumberist(list2)
function is called that computes totals by considering carry's along with sums.
   To test my program, I ran the executable with input and then tried to run it with 
the makefile. When I ran it with manual input, the program worked fine. Sometimes,
however, the program seg faulted if strings with varying size were used. Also
the solution program did not work on my home machine, and I did not have
time to access the machines. Overall, the program is functional.
